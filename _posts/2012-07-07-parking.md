In order to comply with Steve's request (below), I propose that we stage 622KM and the 350 at the ranch while holding 805C at P. R. until I have Samia's group one aboard and am ready to start engines. At that point, I will alert the crew of 805C to launch, which will get them to the ranch in about 15 minutes.
 
Does this work for everyone?
