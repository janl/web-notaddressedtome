My Table of 8

I am supposed to pick 8 women who have touched my life and who I think might participate.

Please send this back to me. Remember to just read the quotation. That's all you have to do.

There is nothing attached. Just send this to 8 women you would like to sit at your table and let me know what happens on the 4th day.

Thank you!!

Quote:
"Today may there be peace within. May you trust that you are exactly where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith in yourself and others. May you use the gifts that you have received and pass on the love that has been given to you. May you be content with yourself just the way you are. Let this knowledge settle into your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, praise and love. It is there for each and every one of us."

Now, send this to 8 women or more within the next 5 minutes.
And remember to send this back, I count as 2. You'll see why. My Table of 8.
