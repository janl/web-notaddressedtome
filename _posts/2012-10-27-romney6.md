Jan,

I always love meeting people -- but I've especially enjoyed getting to know our "Grab a Bite" contest winners. There's just something nice about chatting over a good meal.

You can still enter for a chance to bring a guest and grab a bite with me somewhere on the campaign trail. It'll be a lot of fun, and every entry brings us closer to a Republican victory on November 6th!

Thanks and good luck!

Ann Romney
