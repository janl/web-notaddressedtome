Jan,

The campaign trail can be exhilarating and exhausting -- but never dull. People are fired up about securing a Republican victory on November 6th -- and that excitement is evident on the road.

This contest is a chance for one lucky supporter and a guest to experience that excitement firsthand -- so I wanted you to know about it!

For today only, donate to be automatically entered for a chance to meet me somewhere on the road. Your contribution will also help Romney-Ryan and the Republican team expand the map.

Thank you and good luck!

Paul Ryan
